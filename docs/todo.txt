In Section 2 (Mutation Perturbation)

- Default values of mutenm have not been actualized.

- The "accuracy" of mutation models is bullshit. Each model in itself is calculated exactly. The main difference is not whether one is accurate or more accurate, but that with lfenm there's no change of kmat thus no change of mutions/dynamics due to mutations, whereas sclfenm recalulates self-consistently the kmat thus allows calculation of mutational changes of dynamics (and, as a result, changes in entropy contributions to free energy changes).


- In "How mutations work" it's well described, but it should be said that while lfenm doesn't change kmat, sclfenm, once the mutant structure is calculated, it recalustes kmat (i.e the ENM)


Section 3 (Mutation Response Scanning)

- "Memory-efficient" has to do with a previous inefficient version that doesn't exist anymore: just remove this qualification.
Just describe what the function does (i.e. loops over single-point mutants, calculates various responses, and averages (see code))



Section 4 (Pairwise Comparison Functions)

Not only are they used internally by mrs(), they're exported, so they're functions that can be run by the user. 


The logic is inconsistent: the document has some comparison functions by themselves (structure and motion), other groups with single-protein functions (section 5 "Energy Functions". This should be reorganized, the hierarchy should be:

Structure Functions:

	Single protein 
	Pair comparison

Motion Functions
	Single protein
	Pair comparison

Energy Functions
	Single protein
	Pair comparison

Other Functions
	Single protein
	Pair comparison
