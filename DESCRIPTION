Description: Build elastic network models (ENMs) of proteins and simulate
    mutation effects using linear response theory. Given a wild-type ENM,
    generate mutant ENMs to study how mutations affect protein structure and
    dynamics. Perform mutation response scanning (MRS) across all sites to
    identify structurally important and sensitive residues.
