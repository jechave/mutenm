\description{
Systematically scans all sites, simulating mutations and calculating response
properties for each.

\details{
Mutation Response Scanning (MRS) applies \code{\link{mutenm}} to every site
in the protein, generating \code{nmut} random mutations per site and averaging
the responses. This produces response tibbles that characterize how mutations
at each site affect the protein's structure, dynamics, and energetics.

\subsection{Why multiple mutations per site?}{
Each call to \code{mutenm} generates random perturbations to spring lengths.
By simulating \code{nmut} independent mutations at each site and averaging,
we obtain more robust estimates of the typical mutation response at that site.
}

\subsection{Memory efficiency}{
Uses a process-and-discard approach: each mutant is generated, analyzed, then
discarded before creating the next. This keeps memory usage constant regardless
of protein size.
